About a week ago I finished <a title="Algorithms, Part I" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI" target="_blank">Algorithms, Part I </a>course on Coursera. Few thoughts after completing this course:

  * good course by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne that is focused primarily on algorithms and their analysis
  * great refresher especially for those who worked in the industry for a while
  * course uses Java as programming language, but having very little Java experience wasn&#8217;t a problem, being proficient in C++ and especially C# helped a lot
  * the course focuses mostly on application of existing algorithms but does not focus on the algorithm design which is its biggest drawback
  * Dr. Java IDE that comes with the course is terrible. Instead, I used Eclipse and version of Java that the default course setup installs on your machine (see previous post on <a title="Configuring Eclipse IDE for Algorithms, Part I (Coursera)" href="http://www.rubaniuk.com/?p=365" target="_blank">how to configure Eclipse</a> for this course)
  * the course does **not** provide a verified certificate which is a bummer especially after all the hard work
  * all of the programming tasks were fun and challenging
  * lecture and slides are helpful but you obviously need to do your own learning in addition to that

In order to be successful in this class, you need to:

  * make sure you keep delivering exercises and programming assignments before the due date or at least hard deadline. For me it was a big challenge in the beginning due to packed schedule but I had supportive environment and overall experience was smooth.
  * do not study if you&#8217;re tired after work &#8211; instead, get a good night of sleep and study when your brain is fresh &#8211; sounds like a no-brainer but it&#8217;s not so obvious until you experience double load &#8211; both at work and in the class
  * do not use Dr Java &#8211; it&#8217;s almost impossible to debug your code fast, especially complex data types. Install Eclipse. Enough said.
  * try to have fun and enjoy every moment of it!

Overall, I recommend this class.
