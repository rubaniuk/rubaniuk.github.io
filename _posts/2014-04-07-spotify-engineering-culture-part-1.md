This video definitely worth the time. I wasn&#8217;t too surprised to see Henrik Kniberg there, I remember my team used <a title="Scrum and XP from the Trenches" href="http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Trenches-Enterprise-Software-Development/dp/1430322640/ref=la_B007AK6OT4_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396651757&sr=1-3" target="_blank">his Agile philosophy</a> back in HiQ/MobilEyes when we worked on Symbian/UIQ project.
