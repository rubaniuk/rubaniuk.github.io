Steve Ballmer gives a great lecture at Harvard:

**Update:** I actually met him in ProClub locker room in Bellevue right before Christmas. It was a little surprising to see him there but I&#8217;ve heard from friends that you see him there often. So I just commented that his lecture was really good especially the aspects about luck and being hardcore. He was flattered and simply hi-fived me ðŸ™‚
