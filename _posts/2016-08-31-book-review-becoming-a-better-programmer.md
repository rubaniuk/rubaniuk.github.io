book_review_summary:
  - |
    This book may serve as your mentor in case you do not have a large network of successful and experienced ones.
    
    It covers most of the topics you will experience in life of a professional software engineer: programming, testing, practicing, working with people and being more efficient at your job. I've found Part III Getting Personal and first chapter of Part IV Getting Things Done useful, but it just me. Your mileage may very - depending on your experience and time spent in the software industry,
    
    Few important things are missing from this book: politics of large and small organizations, climbing corporate ladder &amp; truly achieving amazing results as a software engineer.
    
    But to get you started, this book will be good enough.
