<em>| Software Developer: best job in America</em>

By and large, it&#8217;s true. Every year job ratings are published and positions in the software industry are at the top. As software engineers, we became desensitized to issues that professionals in other industries have: high stress, immoral behavior, risk to life, etc.

We tend to live in a tech bubble and take for granted the following attributes of a job that other workers can only <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">dream about:</span>

  * <span style="line-height: 14px;">interesting and challenging work</span>
  * ability to learn and grow every day
  * smart colleagues
  * fast-growing industry and stable employment
  * great pay and benefits
  * flexible work hours

Us software engineers are spoiled due to a competition for talent, tech industry growth and opportunity to build the Next Big Thing. But how do you choose a proper team and the right opportunity?

**First,** you need to get a critical mass of interviews. When you have 5-6 teams or companies that would like to interview you, and you think you can work for them, that&#8217;s a good start.

**Second,** you need to prepare for the Technical Interview, including coding on whiteboard and the ability to create solid designs in a matter of minutes.

There are plenty of books that cover the first and second steps above. However, very rarely do you see another aspect of interviewing that&#8217;s just as important as the first two. Ready?

**Third, you need to prepare to Interview your Interviewer.**

Wait, aren&#8217;t you supposed to be answering all their questions and make a solid impression of the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a> or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack" target="_blank">John Carmack</a>? Yes, but in the 5-10 minutes that you have to ask questions you need to excel at getting insider information.

You need to come to the interview prepared with knowledge of the company/team. Personal connections, Linked and Glassdoor will help.

During the interview, when you are finally allowed to ask questions, you need to cut through new-hire brochure BS and, <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">like a cold-blooded KGB agent, get all the information there is about position, team and company. You need to ask right questions and observe the behavior of the interviewer.</span>

<span style="line-height: 14px;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Good Signs:</span></span></span>

  * <span><span style="line-height: 14px;">interviewers look genuinely happy and you feel good vibe</span></span>
  * interviewers are laughing
  * interviewer are asking smart questions and focus on the right things
  * interviewers are not afraid to answer your questions
  * interviewers are not afraid to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">hiring manager is answering your questions without any fear or doubt and is generally confident</span>

Red Flags:

  * <span style="line-height: 14px;">hiring manager is not answering your questions and instead talks about something not related</span>
  * hiring manager constantly interrupts you
  * you get the impression that interviewer is arrogant, and it is orders of magnitude worse if you feel that several interviewers were arrogant
  * hiring manager/interviewer is not enthusiastic about the project
  * team members don&#8217;t show excitement about the work

<span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Very rarely have I seen teams with arrogant and/or incompatible people delivering great results. They maybe 2nd, 3rd but they will never be Number 1. Over time, personality conflicts will prevail. </span></span><span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">According to Harvard Business School professor <a href="http://www.noamwasserman.com/" target="_blank">Noam Wasserman</a>, and author of the famous book &#8220;The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">, 65% of </span>start-ups<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> fail due to </span>people<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> factor and interpersonal relationships.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">One last </span>piece of advice <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">If you are interviewing for a small company: make sure you interview all team members, especially if it&#8217;s a young company. Otherwise you may find yourself disagreeing with a co-founder who &#8220;was sick&#8221; on the day of your interview.</span>

Good luck with interviews!
